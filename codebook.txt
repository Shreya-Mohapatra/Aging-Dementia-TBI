The variables used from query.csv

i. apo_e4_allele: cholesterol carrier gene allele apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4); one of the biggest risk factors for late onset AD.
ii. cerad: degree of amyloid deposition; scored from 0 (none) to 3 (frequent/severe), as defined by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease
iii. braak: the postmortem scoring of progressive AD neuropathology (neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)) in different brain regions; Stages I and II indicate “neurofibrillary tangle presence confined primarily to the transentorhinal region of the brain”, stages III and IV indicate “limbic region involvement i.e. the hippocampus”, and stages V and VI indicate “extensive neocortical involvement”.
iv. act_demented: Any dementia noted during subject's tenure in the ACT study; Noted as Y/N.
v. ever_tbi_w_loc: Identification of TBI vs. control cases; Noted as Y/N.

act_demented & ever_tbi_w_loc were combined to form the variable disease_condition: No Dementia + No TBI, Dementia w/t TBI, TBI w/t Dementia, Dementia & TBI.
